    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "As an [article](http://grantland.com/features/the-economics-moneyball/) in Grantland, a sports blog, puts it: \"The Moneyball thesis is simple: Using statistical analysis, small-market teams can compete by buying assets that are undervalued by other teams and selling ones that are overvalued by other teams.\"\n",
    "The key to Moneyball is figuring out how to know when a player is \"undervalued.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we will be looking at statistics from the National Basketball Association ([NBA](http://www.nba.com)). \n",
    "Among other statistics, we will mainly be looking at statistics that involve some sort of hustling. Hustle statistics try to measure how much effort a player puts in, meaning how hard they play. These statistics include screen assists, deflections, loose balls recovered, charges drawn, contested shots, steals, and offensive rebounds, which we will explain in detail below.  We would like to find some sort of correlation between a hustle score that we calculate ourselves and other statistics.  Ideally, our findings will help teams seek specific players due to their hustle scores. ([Read more](https://stats.nba.com/articles/dig-deeper-into-the-game-with-new-defensive-and-hustle-data/) about hustle statistics.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.A Previous Work\n",
    "While research has been done related to normal statistics in the NBA (e.g. points per game, assists per game, field goal percentage, rebounds per game) little work has been done related to hustle statistics.  Igor Stančin and Alan Jović of the University of Zagreb published a [paper](https://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/939840.MIPRO_2018_Stancin_Jovic_final_revised.pdf) looking into the differences between winning teams and losing teams for several hustle statistics. However, they did not calculate a total hustle score for a player or for a team. Mark White and Kennon Sheldon published a [paper](https://link-springer-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/article/10.1007/s11031-013-9389-7) looking at players' performance before, during, and after their contract years. While they did look at several normal NBA statistics, they did not incorporate advanced hustle statistics into their paper. Landon Drew Laporte wrote a [paper](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/bitstream/handle/1840.20/33510/etd.pdf?sequence=1) researching hustling in basketball. While his paper does go in depth on how to identify hustlers and how to predict hustling, he does not look for correlation with other statistics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the hustle statistics from the NBA have only existed since the beginning of the 2016-2017 season. Therefore, not a lot of work has been done concerning them. In our project we try to find significance in the NBA's hustle statistics."

    "Typically, the **point guard** is the leader of the team when on the court. Being the point guard requires polished ball handling skills and the ability to facilitate the team during a play. The **shooting guard** is generally the best shooter and is usually capable of shooting from farther distances. Generally, they also have good ball-handling skills. The **small forward** often has an aggressive approach to the basket on offense. The **power forward** and the **center** are usually called \"low post\" players. They often act as their team's primary rebounders and shot blockers. In addition, they generally get the ball closer to the hoop to take inside shots. The **center** is typically the larger of the two. [Read more](https://www.basketballforcoaches.com/basketball-positions/) about the different positions in basketball."

    "\n",
    "1. **Screen Assists** — A screen assist is a [screen](https://www.coachesclipboard.net/Screens.html) that directly leads to a made field goal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deflections** — A deflection occurs when a defensive player redirects the intended direction of the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loose Balls Recovered** — A loose ball is when neither team is in control of the ball.  A loose ball recovered is when a player recovers a loose ball.   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Charges Drawn** — A [charge](http://www.playsportstv.com/basketball/basketball-rules_fouls_the-charge), or player-control foul, occurs when a dribbler charges into a defender who has already established his position.  When a defender takes a charge on an offensive player, the defensive player is awarded a drawn charge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Contested Shots** — A contested shot is when a defender is within 4 feet of the person shooting. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Steals** — A [steal](https://www.sportslingo.com/sports-glossary/s/steal-basketball/) is when a defender legally causes a turnover by his positive, defensive actions.   \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Offensive Rebounds** — An offensive rebound is when an offensive player secures a rebound.\n",
    "\n",
    "These stastics are all hustle related. We believe that players who hustle more generally have higher values for these statistics. Therefore, these are the 7 statistics we use to calculate our hustle score."

    "In order to calculate our hustle score, we will use the sum of screen assists, deflections, loose balls recovered, charges drawn, contested shots, steals, and offensive rebounds.  However, if we just took the sum of those statistics for each player, certain statistics, such as contested shots, would effect the overall hustle score more than others because that statistic is generally higher than the others.  Therefore, we normalize each statistic by dividing its value by the maximum for that specific statistic. Finally, we calculate this hustle score on a per 36-minute basis, which is normal when calculating statistics in basketball.

    "In our project, we tried to create a meaningful statistic to gauge player performance. To do this, we used advanced statistics from the NBA to create what we called a **HustleScore** for each player. We had trouble finding correlation between a player's HustleScore and other statistics for individual players.  However, we noticed that a team's HustleScore had a significant positive correlation with a team's overall wins.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of future work, there are other advanced statistics that could be incorporated into calculating the HustleScore for each player. Some of these [statistics](https://stats.nba.com/players/speed-distance/?sort=DIST_MILES_DEF&dir=1&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) include average MPH, distance traveled, and boxouts. These statistics might improve our correlations and predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these findings, we would recommend that NBA general managers look more into a team's hustle when trying to create a championship team. Our statistics show that a team that hustles more wins more. Due to the fact that wins is the most important team statistic, we conclude that our HustleScore is a meaningful statistic.
