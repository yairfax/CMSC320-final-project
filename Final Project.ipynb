The **small forward** often has an aggressive approach to the basket on offense. The **power forward** and the center are usually called \"low post\" players. They often act as their team's primary rebounders and shot blockers, and also generally get the ball closer to the hoop to take inside shots. The **center** is typically the larger of the two.
